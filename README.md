# Running Facets with DOSBox

This directory contains all the files and binaries necessary to run 
[facdos](https://www.winsteps.com/facdos.htm) in Windows 7/10, 
[Facets](https://www.winsteps.com/facets.htm) released in 1999.


## Usage

1. Specify the input file path of Facet in `mymodel.bat`
2. Execute `startDos.bat` by double-clicking the file (on Windows)

On a machine other than Windows, you might need to figure out how to start
[DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com) on that platform.
